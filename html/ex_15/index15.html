    <h1>Forty-six people to hospital after suspected carbon monoxide leak at hotel</h1>
    <aside>
      <p>Winnipeg emergency officials say 46 people have been taken to hospital due to a suspected carbon monoxide leak
        at a hotel.
        John Lane, chief of Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service, says 15 of those people are in critical condition and five
        are considered to be in unstable condition.
        He says emergency crews were called after an automatic carbon monoxide alarm went off at a Super 8 on Portage
        Avenue.</p>

  <h1>Seven Oaks ER conversion to happen July 22</h1>
  <aside>
    <p>A memo circulated to staff on Tuesday morning to staff detailed the upcoming changes later this month. The ER
      was set to close to in September before the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority announced last month it would
      close earlier in the summer.
      “The decision to convert earlier than the original September date is based on clinical input from site
      leadership here, as well as both the WRHA and Shared Health,” the memo read. “It is also based on careful
      analysis of the staffing resources available within the emergency department for the remainder of the summer.
      This conversion, along with the completion of the labour adjustment changes, will help stabilize the demands on
      nursing staff at our site.”</p>
